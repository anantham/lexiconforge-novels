The game that was boasted as the absolute hardest strategy game, 『Dungeon Attack』.\n\nI used to be the ‘hero’ that had accomplished everything in this game, but after answering a suspicious survey, I found myself in the game as the weakest Demon Lord, 「Dantalian」.\n\nWith only my eloquent tongue and my memories of conquest as a hero—.\n\nIn order to survive as Dantalian. I shall tear this world apart.",
